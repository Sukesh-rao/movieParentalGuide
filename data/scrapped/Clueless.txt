The entire script to Cluelessincluding important actions, songs from thesoundtrack, and my own personal comments.Just hit the little speaker nextto the character's name to hear the lines from the movie (They'renot working yet). I hope you enjoy reading it as much as I enjoyedwriting it. It's amazing the things you pick up when watching a scene 50times. One thing: this is written by a hopelessly devoted and loyal AliciaSilverstone fan, so some of the commentary may be biased. But, I figureif you're reading this then you must have some interest her. Enjoy.Any suggestions, errors, anything?!

But it's like, when I had this garden party formy father's birthday right? I said R.S.V.P. because it was a sit-down dinner.But people came that like, did not R.S.V.P. so I was like, totallybuggin'. I had to haul ass to the kitchen, redistribute the food, squishin extra place settings, but by the end of the day it was like, the morethe merrier! And so, if the government could just get to the kitchen, rearrangesome things, we could certainly party with the Haitians. And in conclusion,may I please remind you that it does not say R.S.V.P. on the Statue ofLiberty?(Class breaks into applause)CHERThank you very much.MR HALLUh, Amber?

Now, is there a Christian Stobich in this class?CHERMR. Hall? The buzz on Christian is that his parentshave joint custody, so he'll be spending one semester in Chicagoand one semester here.

I can't eat, I can't sleep, I can'tstudy.MISS STOEGERThey're slime, they're slime, I mean they're horrible,don't feel bad, don't feel bad, I know, and you see they're all like this.CHER V.O.Then I promised Miss Giest I'd start a letter writingcampaign to my congressman about violations of the clean air act.But Mr. Hall was totally rigid. He said my debateswere unresearched, unstructured, and unconvincing, AS IF!I felt impotent and out of control, which I reallyhate. I needed to find sanctuary in a place where I could gather my thoughtsand regain my strength.SCENE VIII - THE MALLDIONNEDude, what's wrong? Are you suffering from buyer'sremorse or something?(Watch Cher flick her head)CHERGod, no! Nothing like that. It's just that, we'vebeen shopping all day and I still don't know what to do about Mr. Hall.I have tried everything to convince him of my scholastic aptitude, butI was brutally rebuffed.DIONNEGet over it, OK. He's a miserable little man who wantsto make everyone else miserable too.CHERDee, that's it! We've got to figure out a way to makeMr. Hall sublimely happy.SCENE IX - SCHOOLCHER V.O.Here's the four-one-one on Mr. Hall. He's single,he's 47, and he earns minor duckets for a thankless job. What that manneeds is a good healthy boinkfest. Unfortunately, there was a major babedrought in our school. The evil trolls from the math department were actuallymarried,... oooh Snickers... and in the grand tradition of P.E. teachers,Ms. Stoeger seemed to be same-sex oriented. Of course, there was alwaysMiss Giest. Something told me not to discount Miss Giest. Well sure, shehas runs in her stockings, and her slip is always showing, and she alwayshas more lipstick on her teeth than her mouth. God, this woman is screamingfor a make-over. I'm her only hope.(Cher is writing a note outsideMiss Giest's pidgeon hole)DIONNERough winds do shake the darling buds of May but thyeternal summer shall not fade. Phat! Did you write that?CHERDuh, it's like a famous quote.DIONNEFrom where?CHERCliff's notes.DIONNEOh.(Travis and Miss Giest walkout of her office toward where Cher and Dionne have split the scene)MISS GIESTI know you're going to be better now. Now, you runalong and I'll see you third period and you will try to remember to bringyour textbook.TRAVISUh, OK.(Miss Giest reads the note leftby the girls and her face brightens)DIONNEOh, my God!

By far the most tardiesin the class. Congratulations.(The whole class cheers andapplaudes. Travis approaches the podium)TRAVIS This is so unexpected, I, uh, I didn't even have aspeech prepared. Uh, but I would like to say this: Tardiness is not somethingyou can do all on your own. Many, many people contributed to my tardiness.Uh, I'd like to thank my parents for never giving me a ride to school,the L.A. city bus driver for taking a chance on an unknown kid, and, uh,last but not least, the wonderful crew at McDonalds for spending hoursmaking those egg McMuffins, without which I might never be tardy.MR HALL Well, if Mr. Berkenstock has no political messagesto include in his speech, I'll go on. Cher Horowitz, two tardies.CHERI object! Do you recall the dates of these allegedtardies?(Cher in lawyer mode. Legendary!)MR HALLOne was last Monday!CHERMr. Hall, I was surfing the crimson wave, I had tohaul ass to the ladies'.MR HALLI assume your referring to women's troubles, and soI'll let that one slide.CHERThank you, Mr. Hall. Miss Giest was right about you.MR HALLWhat do you mean?CHERWell, she said that you were the only one in thisschool with any intelligence.SCENE X - CHER'S HOUSEMELCher, get in here!CHERYes, Daddy?MELWould you tell me what the hell this is?CHERUm, a second notice for three outstanding tickets.I don't remember getting a first notice.MELThe ticket is the first notice. I didn't even knowyou could get tickets without a licence.CHEROh, sure you can. You can get tickets anytime.MELOh, is that so?(Cher nods)Well not around here you can't. From this moment on,you will not drive, sit, do anything in that jeep without a superviseddriver present. And no cruisin' around with Dionne, alright? Two permitsdo not equal a licence! Do I make myself clear?CHERYes, Daddy.MELCher, I expect you to become a good driver. I wantto see you apply yourself.CHERI will. I'm gonna practise real hard.MELOK.(The scene moves to the poolside)CHER V.O. A licenced driver with nothing to do? Where wouldI find such a loser?CHERHey, granola breath, you got something on your chin.JOSHI'm growing a goatee.CHEROh, that's good. You don't want to be the last oneat the coffee house without chin pubes.JOSHI can't tell you how much I enjoy these little chatsof ours, but in the interest of saving time, why don't you just tell mewhat you want.CHEROK. So, actually, I have a permit and I can driveand all, but Daddy says I can't take the jeep out without a licenced driver,and since your not doing anything and all, you know?JOSHWhat are the chances of you shutting up until youget your way?CHERHmmm, slim to none.

Me mightget Marky Mark to plant a celebrity tree.CHERHow fabulous. Getting Marky Mark to take time fromhis busy pants-dropping schedule to plant trees? Josh, why don't you justhire a gardener?JOSHYou know, maybe Marky Mark wants to use his popularityfor a good cause, make a contribution. In case you have never heard ofthat, a contribution is the giving of...CHERExcuse me, but I have donated many expensive Italianoutfits to Lucy...JOSHtime... funds...CHERAnd as soon as I get my licence I fully intend tobrake for animals, and I have contributed many hours helping two lonelyteachers find romance.JOSH Which I'll bet serves your interest more than theirs.You know, if I ever saw you do something that wasn't ninety percent selfish,I'd die of shock.CHEROh, that'd be reason enough for me.SCENE XII - SCHOOLCHERWould you call me selfish?DIONNENo. Not to your face.CHERReally?DIONNEWhat's wrong? Is Josh giving you shit because he'sgoing through his post-adolescent idealistic phase?CHERLook, there's Mr. Hall.(The girls run over to Mr. Hall)Mr. Hall, Mr. Hall, Mr. Hall, um, do you drink coffee?MR HALLWell, not from this cafeteria. But, uh, yes undernormal circumstances.CHERWell, I am such a retard. When I was packing Daddy'slunch this morning I gave him my lemon snapple, and I took his sucky Italianroast. Do you want it?MR HALLAre you sure you don't want it?CHERDuh, it might stunt my growth. I wanna be 5'10"like Cindy Crawford.
