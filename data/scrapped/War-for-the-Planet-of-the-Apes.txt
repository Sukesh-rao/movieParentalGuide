WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES Written by Mark Bomback & Matt Reeves Based on Characters Created by Rick Jaffa & Amanda Silver FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT NOVEMBER 30, 2015 BLACK SCREEN PRIMITIVE WAR DRUMS POUND OMINOUSLY... as a LEGEND BEGINS: Fifteen years ago, a scientific experiment gone wrong gave RISE to a species of intelligent apes... and destroyed most of humanity with a virus that became known as the Simian Flu. The word "RISE" lingers, moving toward us as it FADES... With the DAWN of a new ape civilization led by Caesar, the surviving humans struggled to coexist... but fighting finally broke out when a rebel ape, Koba, led a vengeful attack against the humans. The word "DAWN" lingers, moving toward us as it FADES... The humans sent a distress call to a military base in the North where all that remained of the U.S. Army was gathered. A ruthless Special Forces Colonel and his hardened battalion were dispatched to exterminate the apes. Evading capture for the last two years, Caesar is now rumored to be marshaling the fight from a hidden command base in the woods... as the WAR rages on... The word "WAR" lingers, moving toward us... TURNING RED as the REST OF THE TITLE FADES UP and the DRUMS ABRUPTLY STOP: WAR FOR THE PLANET OF THE APES We HEAR sounds of nature. Then the quiet SNAPPING OF TWIGS. BOOTS CRUNCHING stealthily through grass. HUSHED BREATHING. HARD CUT TO: TIGHT CREEPING STEADICAM BEHIND THE HELMETS OF HUMAN SOLDIERS Scrawled on the helmet closest to us are the words "MONKEY KILLER." Others pass through frame: "BEDTIME FOR BONZO," "ENDANGERED SPECIES"... The SOLDIERS climb slowly up -- A STEEP, DENSELY WOODED HILL The troops wear threadbare camo fatigues, dark camo paint on their faces; each bears the hand-drawn insignia "A" on their bodies: some on their uniforms, some tattooed on their arms. Many carry GUNS, others MILITARY-GRADE CROSSBOWS. One of the men comes to a halt, quickly WHISPERS: SOLDIER Captain...! (CONTINUED) 2.CONTINUED:The CAPTAIN holds up a hand, signalling the unit to stop. Hejoins the Soldier, who points up ahead. The Captain peersTHROUGH HIS GUN SITE to see --THREE APES AND THEIR HORSESup on a ridge 100 yards away. Two of the APES stand guardfurtively, one clutching a spear, the other an automaticrifle -- while the third waters the horses at a stream.The Captain lines up his cross-hairs... when ANOTHER SOLDIERcreeps right up behind him, reaching for him... but as thehand lifts into frame, we see -- it's an APE HAND...The ape hand GRABS the Captain's shoulder; startled, hequickly turns -- and the ape soldier (RED) POINTS up to --THE CANOPY OF TREES OVERHEAD -- where another HELMETED APEcrouches, hidden, looking down at them -- the ape in the treePOINTS toward the ridge... The Captain follows the gesture toa LONG, LOW TRENCH WALL of logs and stones, disguised behindleaves and branches.Captain turns back to Red, nods; WHISPERS INTO HIS HEADSET: CAPTAIN Echo two-six to command. Colonel, we have eyes on three Kong in the north woods. A couple of our donkeys think there are others here too... Maybe this is it, maybe the base is near. (listens carefully) Yes sir... Yes sir, copy. Over.He clicks off, quickly waves up more soldiers from the rear.They begin pulling weapons and ammo from heavy rucksacks thatRed and TWO OTHER APE SOLDIERS carry on their backs. Theapes seem subservient, treated as no more than pack-mules. CAPTAIN (CONT'D) You! Over here!An ape scurries over; the Captain pulls out a grenadelauncher -- turns to the men: CAPTAIN (CONT'D) Preacher...PREACHER, a fresh-faced grunt still in his teens, crawls upnervously with his CROSSBOW; the Captain points at the threeapes up on the ridge: (CONTINUED) 3.CONTINUED: (2) CAPTAIN (CONT'D) The one with the gun...Preacher NODS as the Captain readies his own weapon, liningup on the partially-hidden trench wall.

The two apes by the stream jump ontheir horses, starting to flee, when a SNIPER takes one out!But the APE WITH THE SPEAR manages to escape, SCREECHING inwarning as he disappears into the distance.The Captain turns to Preacher and the other men, waving themon -- we can't even hear his voice over the DIN OF BATTLE: CAPTAIN (CONT'D) (COME ON!!)The humans charge up the hill, continuing their assault -- CUT TO:THE APE WITH SPEAR ON HORSEBACK RACING THROUGH THE WOODSHooves pounding dirt!

One is the Captain.The ROAR OF APPROACHING APES grows louder and louder...Panicked, Preacher clambers over the corpses, pulls theCaptain's headset off, clicks it on with trembling hands: PREACHER Colonel -Â­ Colonel, do you copy?!An excruciating beat... then a crackle of static... finally aVOICE -- something almost chilling about how calm it is: THE COLONEL (V.O.) Who is this? PREACHER Preacher -- it's Preacher, sir -- ! THE COLONEL (V.O.) Where are you, soldier? I need your position. PREACHER I don't know -- ! THE COLONEL (V.O.) (unfazed) What do you see? PREACHER I can't see anything! We lost a lot of men, sir -- the captain is dead! THE COLONEL (V.O.) You're in command now. PREACHER Command, sir? I think it's just me by myself now!

THE COLONEL (V.O.) (silence, solemnly) I understand, soldier. Just kill as many as you can.And before Preacher can reply, he peers up to see APEWARRIORS converging around the edge of the ditch, glaringdown at him. Preacher freezes, braced for death, and we -- CUT TO:A TRACKING POV SHOT - MOMENTS LATERThe battle's grim aftermath, an almost surreal vision of theravages of war. Apes scavenge for weapons, stripping GUNSAND AMMUNITION off the bodies of fallen human soldiers... WECONTINUE MOVING TOWARD A TRENCH, where APE BODIES are beinglifted out and SCORES OF WOUNDED attended to... as we getcloser, apes in the recess below look slowly up at us withreverence... We move DOWN INTO THE TRENCH, more and more apesreacting, nudging each other, alerting everyone to ourarrival, even the injured raise their heads...REVEAL CAESARas he strides through the trench; the POV was his. He looksolder now, but even more imposing. His hardened expressionreveals nothing... but in his eyes we see deep pain, as hetakes in the terrible loss and suffering...He's trailed by TWO GORILLAS, flanking him on either side:his grizzled lieutenant LUCA and a younger, smaller ALBINO(WINTER), who looks overwhelmed by the carnage around them...The three of them finally arrive at an area UNDER earthcover, where they find A GROUP OF HUMAN SOLDIERS on theirknees, helmets lowered, hands bound behind their backs.Spear and other ape warriors stand guard. Seeing Caesar,Spear supplicates deferentially.Caesar turns to the prisoners as they lift their frightenedeyes to his. We see Preacher among them. (CONTINUED) 7.CONTINUED:But one soldier's helmet is still lowered. Spear reachesdown and yanks the helmet off -- revealing Red. Reddefiantly avoids Caesar's gaze.Spear tosses the helmet to Caesar. Caesar examines it, seesthe hand-drawn "A." He looks at the other soldiers, noticesthe same symbol crudely tattooed on one of the soldiers'arms, sees it scrawled on some of the uniforms. His eyesfind it again on the front of Preacher's helmet. PREACHER (nervous, quiet) ...it's... Alpha Omega.Caesar just stares; then LANG, a lean female soldier, "A"tattooed on her neck, speaks, quiet defiance under her fear: LANG Means we're the beginning and end. Humanity's survival depends on us.Just then, the apes around Caesar turn, reacting to thearrival of --MAURICE, the orangutan. Like Caesar, he's older; there's aweariness in his eyes that suggests the war has taken a tollon his gentle spirit. Caesar turns to his old friend. MAURICE (signs gravely) [Twenty-two dead. Many more injured.]Caesar glowers at the soldiers. We see Preacher stillstaring up at him... finally getting up the courage to utter: PREACHER You're him... You're Caesar.Caesar's eyes go to Preacher, caught off guard. PREACHER (CONT'D) We've been looking for you for so long. We heard you had a hidden command base, but we could never find it. Some of us were starting to think you might be dead. But Colonel McCullough said no, you were out here somewhere...Caesar doesn't respond, just keeps glaring at the soldiers.Another soldier (TRAVIS) speaks up -- nerves frayed: TRAVIS Just kill us already... (CONTINUED) 8.CONTINUED: (2) LANG Shut up, man -- TRAVIS What? They're animals, he's gonna slaughter us --Caesar slowly steps toward him... Travis falls silent.And at last CAESAR SPEAKS, a dark edge in his voice: CAESAR I... did not start this war.The humans all hold their breath, gaping up at him. CAESAR (CONT'D) The ape who did... is dead. His name was Koba. I killed him. (then, harder) I only fight now... to protect apes. TRAVIS (steeling himself) Yeah? What about him? (glances at Red) And we got ten more just like him. CAESAR I know these apes. They followed Koba... (looks Red dead in the eye) They tried to kill me. They fear what I will do to them. They believe I cannot forgive. So now they serve you... just to survive.Red glares up at Caesar -- and for the first time heunexpectedly SPEAKS in PRIMITIVE, BASTARDIZED LANGUAGE: RED I no fear you! You must fear! How long you think woods can protect you? Humans destroy you. Their Kerna has all power. Humans follow all he say. To them, he more than just human. He everything.He looks over the apes, who seem chilled... his eyes boringinto Winter's; the young gorilla is unnerved -- RED (CONT'D) He say: first Caesar die... then you all die. (CONTINUED) 9.CONTINUED: (3)Spear ERUPTS, hurling Red to the ground -- when Caesar puts ahand up. Spear restrains himself, eyes still blazing.Caesar looks to Luca, then signs: CAESAR [Get him out of here.]Luca turns to Winter. Winter gathers himself, then drags aresisting Red away. The humans watch, fearful... then turnto Caesar, awaiting their fate...

Leave us the woods. And no more humans will die.The soldiers look at him, fear and defiance in their eyes.Caesar nods to Luca -- who SWATS the horses' hindquarters,sending them on their way. The stunned humans peer back atthe apes as the horses carry them off.TIGHT ON CAESAR AND LUCA as Maurice steps up beside them, andthey WATCH THE HUMANS GO. Finally, Maurice turns to Caesar: MAURICE [Do you really think they'll give him the message?] CAESAR They are the message. I showed them mercy. He will see we are not savages. (then) Let's hope this works. They are getting closer...Just then SHRIEKING is heard -- they turn to see -- (CONTINUED) 10.CONTINUED:A COMMOTION among the apes by the trenches below.

The able march with the injured,helping them keep up; the dead are carried on the backs ofhorses. A LOW ROAR builds as we CUT TO --AN IMPOSING WATERFALLRUSHING down sheer rock-face in an area nestled deep in thewoods. The apes have stopped to gather along the river atthe base of the falls. Shrouded ape bodies are released intothe river. Caesar and Maurice sit side by side, apart fromthe others -- Caesar, troubled: CAESAR Why didn't I see, Maurice?Maurice turns to Caesar. MAURICE [See what?] CAESAR That Koba could not forgive what humans did to him when he was their prisoner. That he would seek revenge. I should have known. MAURICE [No one could have known how much darkness was living inside of him.]A SUDDEN HIGH-PITCHED ALERT rings out, almost like a bugle.They quickly look up to -- (CONTINUED) 11.CONTINUED:THE TREELINE ABOVEwhere we discover they are far from alone, the trees comingto life as APES EMERGE EVERYWHERE!

They lookweary, caked with dust, their horses laden with enough gearto suggest they've been on a long journey.As they dismount, Caesar and a group of others move quicklyto greet them. Caesar stands before Blue Eyes, the two ofthem just looking at each other, overcome. Everyone watches,giving them their space, when finally Blue Eyes signs: BLUE EYES [Hello, Father...]A huge smile spreads across Caesar's face and he embraces hisson. The crowd celebrates, rushing in to join the reunion.Caesar turns to Rocket, the two happy to see each other -- CAESAR Welcome home, Rocket. (grins at Rocket) You look tired.

CAESAR Come inside!They all start toward the waterfall -- as we CUT TO -- 12.THE BACK SIDE OF THE WATERFALLDAYLIGHT plays through the ENORMOUS WALL OF RUSHING WATER, asthe SILHOUETTES of Caesar and the apes appear in front of it,entering around the edge of the falls. They continue intothe cavernous recess as we CUT TO REVEAL we are inside --A HIDDEN FORTRESSLike a primitive castle built into the caves, completelyconcealed behind the waterfall and surrounding rocks. AFLOOD OF CHILDREN converge around them as their MOTHERS runafter them, trying to maintain a little order.Blue Eyes looks through the crowd, spots CORNELIA rushingtoward him, beaming -- he beams back -- BLUE EYES [Mother...!]-- she pulls him into an emotional hug. They both look down,noticing a TODDLER (CORNELIUS) hiding shyly behind her legs. CORNELIA [Cornelius, don't you recognize your brother?]Blue Eyes crouches down, strokes his head. Cornelia grins: CORNELIA (CONT'D) [Someone else missed you too...]Blue Eyes turns, rising to see -- A YOUNG, FEMALE APE aroundBlue Eyes' age (LAKE) standing right behind him.

We can start over. A new home.] (CONTINUED) 13.CONTINUED:Cornelia scoops Cornelius into her lap, gently pulling himaway from the map -- she looks at Blue Eyes, intrigued,points: CORNELIA [What is beyond those mountains, son?]Blue Eyes picks up a pouch beside him and digs his hand in,removing a fistful of SAND; he spills it out dramatically -- BLUE EYES [A desert, Rocket and I had to cross it too. The journey is long, but that is why humans will not find us.]Cornelia smiles, nodding -- she and Caesar exchange a proudlook -- when Winter cuts in anxiously: WINTER [We must leave tonight!] LAKE [Tonight? That's impossible!] WINTER [How much longer can we wait? Soldiers are getting closer!] BLUE EYES (touching Winter's arm) [Winter...]Winter shrugs him off -- Luca and the others all eruptangrily at Winter -- Caesar stands imposingly. Winterimmediately lowers his head, afraid; then, to Caesar: WINTER [Your son's been gone, he doesn't know how hard it's been!] BLUE EYES [I know you are scared, we all are, but we are still planning...] CAESAR Yes...

And we cannot hide here much longer.Caesar looks back down at the map, deep in thought; thenfeels the anxious stares of the apes around him.

HIDDEN FORTRESS - CAESAR'S DWELLING - NIGHTA small cave in the upper levels of the fortress, enclosed onone side by the ROARING FALLS. Caesar sits up, awake, as hisfamily sleeps around him. Troubled, he studies Blue Eyes'map in his lap -- when suddenly he feels something...Caesar looks down to see Cornelius instinctively hugging hisleg as he rests, nuzzled beside his mother. Caesar gazesdown protectively at his little one, strokes his head, thenturns to look back at the map -- when he notices Blue Eyesstaring up at him through heavy lidded eyes.

Caesar returns a hardlook, shakes his head. But Luca is undeterred: LUCA [The soldiers' camp is always moving. My guards think they know where it is. Let me take you.] ROCKET [You'll need me to back you up.]Rocket reveals a rifle in his hand. But Caesar remains firm: (CONTINUED) 23.CONTINUED: CAESAR No. ROCKET [Please... I know what it's like... to lose a son.]That strikes a chord; Caesar looks at him, affected... CAESAR I might not make it back. MAURICE [That's why I'm coming.

Smoke billowsfrom a weathered stovepipe poking through the window of arusted-out Airstream trailer. The only sign of life. (CONTINUED) 24.CONTINUED:REVERSE ON CAESAR, MAURICE, ROCKET AND LUCAspying through the trees on foot, looking apprehensive. Theyexchange uncertain looks -- could this be the base camp?They creep out of the trees for a closer look -- when --A LONE MAN carrying firewood emerges from the forest.He's mid-40s, dirty, unshaven. Seeing the apes, he stops inhis tracks. They all stare, a silent stand-off... Then,very, very slowly, he starts to lower his pile of wood: MAN I'm just gonna... put this down --He drops the wood suddenly, revealing a RIFLE strapped to hisshoulder -- he whips it around -- and FIRES! The shot JUSTMISSES MAURICE, when --BANG! THE MAN DROPS DEAD. Stunned, the apes turn to see --CAESAR clutching his SMOKING GUN, staring distantly at theman he's just killed. The others regard Caesar's grim,steady presence, a bit in shock at his seeming lack ofremorse; a look in his eyes suggests even he knows somethinghas broken within him. A line has been crossed.Finally, Caesar lowers his rifle -- only now aware of theirstares. He turns away, ignoring them, steps toward the man.The others join him, looking down at the body. The tatteredrags he wears are barely recognizable as the fatigues worn bythe human soldiers. "A" is crudely tattooed on his arm. LUCA [Is he out here alone?] ROCKET [Maybe he's a deserter?]Caesar doesn't respond, eyes on the dead man -- when a MUTEDCRASH comes from behind; they all turn to THE AIRSTREAM...

It'slong and narrow, lined with rotted wood panelling, packed andlittered with improvised survivalist essentials.We MOVE with them as Caesar leads the group through theclaustrophobic interior, anxiously scanning for any place ahuman might be hiding... Moving inexorably toward...A CLOSED DOORat the far end of the trailer. The others exchange tenselooks as Caesar readies his gun -- and SMASHES down the door!ON CAESAR, eyes blazing, furiously training his gun as hesees something; he freezes, poised to kill, and we REVEAL --A LITTLE GIRLcowering like a frightened animal against the wall in a lowerbunk bed. She looks no more than 8 or 9 years old. A littlewaif-like figure, her unwashed face is framed by wildlymatted hair. She stares wide-eyed up at --Caesar, gun still trained on her, adrenaline coursing throughhis veins... The faces of the other apes appear behind him,shocked at what they see.Finally, Maurice reaches over, places a hand on Caesar's gun,gently lowers it. Caesar returns to his senses... but stillshows no compassion for the human child. He turns away, tothe others, gesturing coldly at the trailer behind them: CAESAR Look around. Take what we can use.Caesar steps out past them; Rocket and Luca share an uneasylook, then follow.But Maurice remains, eyeing the scared little Girl with amixture of curiosity and pity. He spots something on thefloor by the bed, starts to move toward it...Terrified, the Girl scoots back against the wall, withdrawingas far as she can. But Maurice coos a comforting pant-hootas he reaches down to the floor and retrieves --A CRUDELY-MADE RAG DOLL. He holds it out. She hesitates --then quickly grabs it and retreats to her corner, hugging it.Maurice watches her, then raises his arm, reaching for her.She freezes, nervous eyes following his enormous hand... ashis finger straightens... and gently strokes the doll's head.

PARK - LATE AFTERNOONCaesar and Rocket mount their horses as Luca arrives with theothers. Maurice is about to climb up when he notices --The Girl has followed them out. She wanders toward the deadMan, his gun still a few feet away. She stares at him,looking lost, but not quite sad. Instead she exhibits astrange, almost primitive fascination with his lifeless body.They all gaze at her, uncertain. Maurice turns to Caesar: MAURICE [She'll die out here alone.]Caesar looks at her, a flash of pity in his eyes... but hepushes it away, turns to Maurice, firm: CAESAR We cannot take her.Maurice considers this, nods. MAURICE [I understand...] (then:) [But I cannot leave her.]Caesar stares at him, frustrated... 27.EXT. WOODS - DUSKThe posse on the move again. The Girl rides behind Maurice,arms around him, her cheek pressed into his furry back.Caesar takes in the sight, shoots Maurice a hard look...Maurice returns an assuring nod: it'll be okay.Just then, Luca GRUNTS for their attention. They all turn tosee CROSSES UP AHEAD ON THE SIDE OF THE TRAIL, crudely-boundbranches staked into the ground. They approach warily,stopping as they discover --A LARGE GRAVEYARD amidst the trees. A sea of crosses,marking mounds of dirt. They peer around, a bit unnerved: MAURICE [Must be where they bury the dead.]Rocket nods, when Caesar suddenly notices the TREE TRUNKS arescarred with BULLET HOLES... He glances at the ground,finding scattered BRASS BULLET CASINGS; perplexed, he points: CAESAR Looks like some were killed here.They all look at the shot-up trees and casings, bewildered --when Luca sees a pile of ASHES and CHARRED OBJECTS --BLACKENED EYEGLASSES, BELT BUCKLES, DOG TAGS -- LUCA [They burned their things too.] MAURICE [Why would they kill their own men?]ON CAESAR, mulling the mystery -- when Luca lets out anotherGRUNT; they turn as he points through the trees at pinpricksof FIRE LIGHT and TENTS in the distance.

We FIND ahuge "A" stencilled on the side of one of them. Re-focus onHAND-PAINTED SIGNAGE beside it: "Those who forget the pastare doomed to repeat it." Next to it: "The only good Kong isa dead Kong."

But more of us are leaving to join them in the morning. Red thinks they'll all be coming back here... to help the Colonel finish off the apes for good.]Caesar finally stops, right in front of him. Winter pleads: WINTER (CONT'D) [Please... I know I betrayed you. But can't you see? We'll never beat them. I was just trying to survive. Red told me the humans promised to spare us if we helped. I beg you, forgive me...]But Caesar is unmoved, barely stifling his rage... CAESAR My son... my wife... are dead.Just then -- we hear the LAUGHTER OF HUMANS outside; Winterturns, sees SHADOWS OF SOLDIERS passing on the side of thetent -- he opens his mouth to shriek to them -- but a HANDCLAMPS over his mouth, as Caesar wrestles him to the groundto silence him!

Follow them to the Colonel.]Maurice turns again to Caesar, who is still in his own world,lifting a gourd canteen to his lips.

As she clutches herself against thecold, something catches her eye; she looks up overhead at thePINK FLOWERS of a perennial dogwood tree, poking through thesnow -- the only color in an otherwise stark white world.With the muffled crunch of hooves, Luca and Rocket appear,guiding the four horses toward the porch.Luca notices the Girl staring up at the branch of flowers.He watches a moment, then moves toward her... and reaches hislong arm up, snapping off a small piece of the branch.The Girl observes as Luca bends down, his massive gorillaface right in front of hers as he very gently slips theflowers behind her ear. She smiles. He blinks back at hersweetly, when --Caesar and Maurice emerge onto the porch. Luca quicklystraightens, resuming his tough guy demeanor.Maurice lowers next to the Girl, and she hops on his back.He moves to his horse, and climbs up with her. Caesar,Rocket and Luca mount up as well, when ---- the front door SQUEAKS open; they turn to see Bad Apestepping out to join them. He wears boots, an old woolblanket on his shoulders, and a striped toque on his head. (CONTINUED) 45.CONTINUED:Caesar and the others stare at him, deadpan, but he isoblivious, looking from horse to horse, wondering where he'ssupposed to go.Luca GRUNTS gruffly, points him toward Rocket's horse. BadApe smiles, and starts for Rocket's horse.Rocket looks miserable as Bad Ape struggles to climb up.EXT. SIERRA MOUNTAINS - DAYThe group silently weaves its way through snow-covered trees.The Girl watches curiously as Caesar removes his canteen fromhis saddle bag. Maurice notices her staring, follows hergaze to see Caesar drinking. Maurice grunts softly to her.She turns, and he gestures at Caesar, making the sign for: MAURICE [Thirsty.] (repeats for her, teaching) [Thirsty.]She just stares blankly at Maurice. He takes her small handin his, demonstrating the way to sign the word.Caesar notices, lowering his canteen, quietly intrigued.Maurice demonstrates again. But the Girl shows no interestor understanding. Her eyes return to Caesar -- who for thefirst time softens, offering a sympathetic gaze.EXT. WOODED AREA - LATE AFTERNOONThe group have left the trail, moving through dense forest.Caesar watches Bad Ape who peers anxiously ahead... to whereSUNLIGHT spills in at the edge of the woods. Bad Ape turnsto meet Caesar's eyes, fearful: BAD APE There...Caesar looks at the light, then turns to the others, raisinghis hand for them to stop. CUT TO:EDGE OF THE WOODS - MOMENTS LATEROn foot now, the group presses in close behind the trees atthe forest's perimeter, squinting into the hard, low sun at -- (CONTINUED) 46.CONTINUED:AN ENORMOUS CANYON BELOW THEMSteep, snow-covered granite cliffs slope down in shelves,disappearing into an unseen expanse below.The TOP OF A MASSIVE, PRISON-STYLE WARDEN'S TOWER pokesominously up in the distance, from the center of the chasm.Caesar raises the binoculars, PEERING AT THE TOWER: sunflares off the cement and steel structure, stained withcorrosion. Through the windows, it appears to be DESERTED.Caesar lowers the glasses, staring uncertainly -- when henotices something about the FADED CALIFORNIA STATE FLAGhanging from the tower -- he looks through the binoculars toexamine it: the flag is hung upside-down... and a HUGE "A"has been painted in black across it.Then Caesar suddenly notices movement down below -- he shiftsthe glasses to find TINY SILHOUETTED FIGURES, just barelyvisible along the edge of the lowest visible shelf.Caesar turns, looks from face to face... then: CAESAR [Luca, let's take a closer look.] (to Rocket) [Stay here. Keep them safe.]Rocket nods dutifully, and Caesar and Luca start off -- CUT TO:THROUGH THE BINOCULARS - SUNSETThe HEAVILY SILHOUETTED FIGURES in the distance are stillsmall, but from this closer vantage we can see now they're inthe midst of placing a series of about twelve MYSTERIOUS, X-SHAPED STRUCTURES along the cliff's edge -- maybe this issome kind of defensive perimeter...?REVEAL CAESAR LOWERING HIS BINOCULARS; he looks confused ashe turns to Luca, lying beside him on the edge of a ridge. LUCA [What are they doing?] CAESAR (shakes his head) I don't know... (CONTINUED) 47.CONTINUED:Caesar turns back, looking through the binoculars again,trying to decipher this strange activity -- when Luca GRUNTSat him with quiet alarm. Caesar turns. LUCA (points) [What's that? A patrol?]Caesar looks --THROUGH THE BINOCULARSfinding a PAIR OF HORSES on a ledge right below. CAESAR (O.S.) Don't see riders...Suddenly AN OUT OF FOCUS SHAPE RISES directly in front of thebinoculars -- Caesar drops the glasses to discover --AN ALPHA OMEGA SOLDIER looming right above him, rifle raised!The soldier pulls the trigger -- CLICK -- but the gun isjammed! Panicked, the soldier rears back, about to lungeforward with the rifle's BAYONET -- when --LUCA DIVES PROTECTIVELY in front of Caesar ---- taking the bayonet blade in his gut as he YANKS the mandown, WRESTLING him to the ground! They roll violently,finally coming to a stop, Luca atop the motionless soldier --Caesar's eyes land on the BLOOD-STAINED BAYONET, lying in thesnow beside them -- he scrambles up, rushing to Luca ---- when a SECOND SOLDIER steps out, startling Caesar -- aboutto shoot -- when --WHAM! THE SECOND SOLDIER CRUMPLES, revealing Rocket behindhim, having just clubbed him with the butt of a rifle.Rocket looks to Caesar, signs regretfully, out of breath: ROCKET [I saw them from up there... Coming for you...]They both turn immediately to Luca... who is rollingpainfully off the dead man; he looks at them helplessly,GASPING, clutching his gut... CUT TO: 48.BACK UP IN THE WOODS - DUSKWaiting anxiously at the edge of the trees, Bad Ape, Mauriceand the Girl stare as --ROCKET returns, climbing quickly up toward them, a grimexpression on his face, clutching the bayoneted rifle in hishand... right behind him, CAESAR CARRIES LUCA across hisback, like a Vietnam soldier shouldering a fallen brother.They all retreat into the safety of the woods, the groupconverging around Caesar as he lowers Luca to the ground...Emotion in his eyes, Caesar looks down at his loyal friend.Fading fast, Luca smiles weakly. He manages to raise a hand,holding it out to Caesar; Caesar grasps it firmly. LUCA [At least this time... I was able to protect you...]Deeply affected, Caesar holds Luca's gaze a silent moment,and then Luca releases his grasp, his hand drifting to theground as the rest of the group looks on. Her eyes fixed onthe massive gorilla, the Girl climbs off Maurice's back...The others watch, surprised, as she approaches Luca, climbingonto his chest. She stares down, her little face inches fromhis... for the first time we see deep emotion in her eyes.Luca peers up vulnerably as she removes the twig of flowershe placed behind her ear... and gently tucks it behind his;she begins to cry. Caesar is struck by her display ofemotion. Luca smiles at her, then gradually his smile fadesas his face grows still... and life ebbs from his eyes.TIGHT ON CAESAR, staring intensely at Luca, a mixture of rageand guilt in his eyes. The others watch him silently.Finally, Maurice ventures a SOFT GRUNT to him. Caesar turns. MAURICE [I know how much you have lost... But now we have lost another.]Caesar just stares, inscrutable. MAURICE (CONT'D) [Please... it's not too late to leave this place. To rejoin the others.]Emotion stirring, Rocket cannot hold back -- (CONTINUED) 49.CONTINUED: ROCKET [Luca gave his life! We can not turn back -- !]Maurice remains fixed on Caesar -- MAURICE [Caesar...]But Caesar turns away. He shakes his head grimly; thenutters quietly, consumed: CAESAR They must pay...Everyone stares, until finally, Caesar turns back. His eyesmeet Maurice's, whose gaze now appears judgemental: MAURICE [Now you sound like Koba.]Caesar turns to his friend, suddenly seething; the look inhis eyes is chilling: CAESAR ...Koba? You know nothing. My wife and son were killed. (gestures to Luca) And now my friend. (then, harder) You call me Koba...?!Caesar glares at him, an unprecedented rift between them.Rocket remains still, taken aback... waiting... Then: CAESAR (CONT'D) (trembling with rage) I did not ask you to come. Any of you. This is my fight. I will finish it alone... Go now. Join the others.Stunned, they watch as Caesar rises, and takes the bayonetedrifle from Rocket's shoulder... then heads off, back towardthe canyon...HOLD on the apes' harrowed expressions, watching him; CUT TO:HELICOPTER SHOT HIGH AND WIDE OVER THE GRANITE CLIFFS - NIGHTSWOOPING OVER Caesar's tiny figure as he scales down thevast, snowy expanse in the moonlight; he DROPS down to alower shelf, and we CUT TO: 50.CAESAR'S POVBREATHING HARD (O.S.), MOVING toward the CLIFF'S EDGE -- themassive guard tower reaches up from the canyon beyond it --ON CAESAR, air steaming from his nose; he SLOWS, SEEING --THE TWELVE MYSTERIOUS X-SHAPED STRUCTURES looming ahead --As he approaches we can suddenly start to make out DARK FORMSSTRAPPED to them...? Caesar's expression moves fromconfusion... to dawning horror as he realizes: the formsappear to be APES. He picks up speed again, rushing towardthem, their backs to us -- it's unclear whether the forms aredead or alive...Finally reaching the line of crosses at the edge of thecliff, he finds a GROUP OF APES, all semi-conscious,struggling to breathe, bound to Xs by their hands and feet...Reeling, Caesar whips his head from ape to ape, trying tomake sense of this -- when he HEARS A DREADFUL MURMUR RISINGfrom the canyon; heart racing, he spins, staggering towardthe edge to PEER DOWN --INTO THE CANYONat what looks like a ENORMOUS, FORMER PRISON CAMP at the baseof the sheer mountains, three stories below.As Caesar is drawn inexorably to the very edge of the cliff,OUTDOOR HOLDING PENS come slowly into view... INSIDE THEPENS ARE HUNDREDS OF APES, MURMURING helplessly...THE EXODUS HAS BEEN CAPTURED.Caesar stumbles back from the edge, overwhelmed, in shock...He turns in panic to the bound apes -- suddenly recognizingSPEAR among them. He rushes to Spear's side.Spear looks like he's near death, his head sagging. Caesarlifts Spear's face in both hands -- Spear's eyes slowly open;as they focus on Caesar, he can't believe what he's seeing.Caesar yanks the bayonet off his rifle, quickly cuts Speardown. Spear slumps to his knees -- Caesar crouches to steadyhim as Spear struggles to sign, still stunned to see him. CAESAR What happened?

He said they would use us, before we died.] CAESAR Use you...? SPEAR [They've been forcing us to work!]Caesar turns to look below -- when Spear suddenly gives out,collapsing. Caesar quickly turns -- seeing brutal LASH MARKSacross Spear's back. Horrified, Caesar lifts Spear up,holding him in his arms. CAESAR What... kind of work...?But Spear struggles for consciousness, his eyes flutteringclosed... He begins to collapse -- Caesar is stricken: CAESAR (CONT'D) Wait -- my little son -- is he here...?But Spear just falls to the ground, Caesar watches aghast --when an APE FOOT steps right beside him -- Caesar turns,startled -- looks up to see --RED standing ominously right above him!

A SHAFT OF HARSH LIGHT blasts down from above.Water drops splatter around him.Caesar peers around, struggling to get his bearings, his POVdrifting in and out of focus: he finds TRACKS embedded in theground, a rusted-out TRAIN ENGINE in the shadows.

Caesar crawlsmenacingly toward him -- but is instantly YANKED BACK HARD.GASPING, Caesar reaches for his throat to discover his wristsare shackled and his neck is CHAINED by a NECK COLLAR...Writhing, he turns to see RED cruelly gripping the end of thechain. Preacher takes a step closer, levelling his crossbowthreateningly; Caesar's eyes lock with his. The Colonelwatches their stare-down: THE COLONEL (CONT'D) I hope you don't come to regret sparing his life.

He comes closer, stands right above Caesar, looking athim for a long beat, something about this revelation churningin his mind; Red cautiously tightens his grip on the chain. THE COLONEL I'm sorry. I was there to kill you.Caesar just glares up at him, the Colonel so close... Struck,the Colonel inches even closer: THE COLONEL (CONT'D) My God, look at your eyes... they're almost human...

CUT TO: 65.BLACKNESSThen a DOOR IS OPENED, REVEALING -- we are --INT. WARDEN'S TOWER - NIGHTThe Colonel stands with his back to us, leaning on a map-covered table in the former window-lined control center,smoke rises from sage and grass smudge burning in a tin bowl.CAESAR, PREACHER AND RED ENTERapproaching the Colonel, who still doesn't acknowledge them;as searchlights outside sweep through, Caesar catches a briefglimpse of a room just off the control center -- it looksalmost like a sanctum; light passes over APE SKULLS... theword "HISTORY" scrawled on a wall... then the room goes darkagain. Caesar looks unsettled -- his gaze returning to theColonel, and noticing for the first time painful lookingBRAND SCARS on the back of his hands: one Alpha, one Omega.The Colonel finally speaks, eyes still on the map: THE COLONEL Interfere with the work again, and I'll begin slaughtering the apes, one by one. Understand? I need that wall.He looks up coldly at Caesar, then nods at Preacher: that'sall -- they start to lead Caesar out, but he won't go yet -- CAESAR Apes... need food... water. THE COLONEL (eyes on the map) They'll get food and water when they finish the work. CAESAR Give them food and water... or they will not be able to finish.The Colonel looks up, amused by Caesar's audacity. THE COLONEL You know you're very emotional. (then) What makes you think you're in a position to make demands?Caesar doesn't reply. The Colonel turns back to the map --Preacher nervously tugs again on Caesar's chain -- (CONTINUED) 66.CONTINUED: PREACHER C'mon --But Caesar stands firm, eyes fixed on the Colonel: CAESAR The soldiers who are coming here... are not coming to join you, are they?The Colonel slowly looks up, smiles, suddenly intrigued -- asRed warily tightens his grip on Caesar's chain... CAESAR (CONT'D) I saw men outside by the wall... preparing for battle...The Colonel studies him, surprised: THE COLONEL I was told you were smart, but... that's impressive.He stares at Caesar a moment; then finally: THE COLONEL (CONT'D) No. They won't be joining me. CAESAR They are against you? THE COLONEL They... fear me. CAESAR Why...?The Colonel just looks at him, silent. CAESAR (CONT'D) Because you kill your own men?Preacher tenses; The Colonel holds Caesar's gaze, stunned... CAESAR (CONT'D) We found bodies. (then) Something wrong... with these men.The Colonel shakes his head in awe: THE COLONEL Jesus Christ... you are impressive. (then, almost enjoying this) (MORE) (CONTINUED) 67.CONTINUED: (2) THE COLONEL (CONT'D) Well, you paint quite a picture. What you must think of me. CAESAR I think... you have no mercy.The Colonel goes still, a deep nerve struck. He DARKENS: THE COLONEL You came here to kill me. Were you going to show me mercy? CAESAR I showed you mercy... when I spared your men. I offered you peace. And you killed my family. THE COLONEL (low, with contempt) Mercy. Do you have any idea what your mercy would do to us?Caesar stares warily, confused by the simmering rage he seemsto have provoked in the Colonel. THE COLONEL (CONT'D) You're much stronger than we are. And you're smart as hell. No matter what you say, you'd eventually replace us, that's the law of Nature. The irony is, we created you. We tried to defy Nature, bend it to our will. And Nature's been punishing us for our arrogance ever since. Testing us. Even now.Caesar searches the Colonel's ominous expression... Then: THE COLONEL (CONT'D) Ten months ago, we sent out recon units to look for your base. They found nothing. My own son was a soldier with one of the groups. One day he suddenly stopped speaking. He became... primitive. Like an animal. They contacted me, said they thought he lost his mind, that the war was too much for him. But then the man caring for him stopped speaking too. Their medic had a theory, before he stopped speaking. That the virus that almost wiped us out -- the virus every human survivor still carries Â­- had suddenly changed... Mutated. (peers at Caesar) (MORE) (CONTINUED) 68.CONTINUED: (3) THE COLONEL (CONT'D) And if it spread, it would destroy humanity for good this time. Not by killing us... but by robbing us of the things that make us human. Our speech, our higher thinking... It would turn us into beasts... not unlike what you all used to be. You talk about mercy...? What would you have done?Caesar stares back, unnerved, challenged... he has no answer. THE COLONEL (CONT'D) Well, it was a moment of clarity for me. I realized I would have to sacrifice my only son, so that humanity could be saved. I held that gun in my hand, and I pointed it at my only child. (emotion in his eyes as he remembers) He looked at me with trust in his eyes, all he had left in his primitive gaze. And I pulled the trigger. It purified me. It made my purpose clear.His eyes finally return to Caesar's, who looks stunned. THE COLONEL (CONT'D) I gave orders to kill the other infected, all of them, and anyone who might've been in direct contact, even if they showed no symptoms. We burned their belongings, anything that might spread contamination. Some of the men questioned my judgment. I was asking them to do what I had done: to sacrifice their families... their friends. They refused. So I had them killed too. (growing darker) Others with children deserted into the woods. One of those cowards fled to my superiors up north. They sent officers down to restrain me. They tried to convince me this plague could be dealt with medically, that up there they were already looking for a cure. That's when I realized: they had learned nothing from our past. CAESAR (harrowed) You killed them too...? (CONTINUED) 69.CONTINUED: (4) THE COLONEL What did I do, Preacher? PREACHER (a beat, quietly) You severed their heads, sir. THE COLONEL Except for the one I spared, so he could return to deliver a message: if they wanted to relieve me of my command, they'd have to meet me here, and do it themselves.Caesar stares, his eyes questioning what the Colonel means -- THE COLONEL (CONT'D) This place used to be a weapons depot. They turned it into a relocation camp when the crisis was just beginning. But the weapons are all still here, inside that mountain. (a beat) This is a holy war. All of human history has led to this moment. And if we lose, we'll be the last of our kind. It will be a planet of apes. And we'll become your cattle.Caesar just stares, unsettled; they hold each other's eyes... THE COLONEL (CONT'D) Look at you. You think I'm sick, don't you. CAESAR How many... will be coming? THE COLONEL Probably all of them. Don't get any ideas -- only thing they fear more than me is you apes. They never questioned my methods when it came to you.He moves closer, looking at Caesar's face, his tone quieter: THE COLONEL (CONT'D) I didn't mean to kill your son...Caesar remains totally still as the Colonel studies him...The Colonel's nearness is almost too much to bear... (CONTINUED) 70.CONTINUED: (5) THE COLONEL (CONT'D) (leaning in even closer) But if his destiny was to inherit your unholy kingdom... then I'm glad I did.A sudden rage surges behind Caesar's eyes -- HE LUNGES -- !The Colonel LEAPS BACKWARD -- Caesar's fingers GROPING FORHIS THROAT as he SCRAMBLES out of reach JUST IN TIME -- RedSUDDENLY SEIZES CAESAR'S CHAIN -- WRENCHING CAESAR BACK HARD!The Colonel HITS the floor, FLASK tumbling from his jacket --Panicked, FURIOUSLY LEVELS HIS CROSSBOW -- SCREAMING -- PREACHER HEY -- HEY-HEY-HEY!!!CAESAR SEETHES, raging in vain against the restraint --In shock, the Colonel gathers himself, picks up the flask,self-consciously pocketing it as he stands, backing away --he touches the side of his neck to find Caesar nicked him.He looks at the BLOOD on his fingers with a rush, smilingbreathlessly as Caesar strains, CHOKING in Red's grasp: THE COLONEL So emotional!The Colonel watches, smile fading as Caesar finally relents: THE COLONEL (CONT'D) I can see how conflicted you are. You're confused in your purpose. You're angry at me because of something I did that was an act of war. But you're taking this all much too personally.Preacher watches as The Colonel steps forward, venturingcloser to Caesar, seemingly unconcerned for his safety... PREACHER ...sir --The Colonel holds up his hand to silence Preacher as he stopsright in front of Caesar again, eye to eye... Caesar burns,tortured by the agonizing effort to restrain his rage... THE COLONEL What do you think my men would've done to your apes... if you had killed me?Caesar looks up at the Colonel. The Colonel holds Caesar'sangry stare as he starts slowly forward: (CONTINUED) 71.CONTINUED: (6) THE COLONEL (CONT'D) Or is killing me more important...?The Colonel lingers tauntingly... finally, he turns toPreacher -- and as Preacher and Red move in, we -- CUT TO:PREACHER AND RED MARCHING CAESAR OUT OF THE DEPOT - NIGHTThey head for the yard -- Preacher utters quietly, shaken: PREACHER Didn't I tell you not to agitate him? That was not smart, man...Caesar glances at Preacher, then at Red behind them; he turnsforward, speaks softly to Preacher, a hint of sympathy: CAESAR If this battle is coming... you should leave, while you still can.Preacher turns to him; then abruptly stops: PREACHER Leave? What are you talking about? CAESAR You are not like him.Preacher looks at Caesar, taken aback -- maybe even offended: PREACHER He was right, you do think he's sick, don't you? You're just like them. He's not crazy. The world's gone crazy. And he's the only one with the vision to get us through this. The Colonel's a great man. He sacrificed everything for us. You can't judge him. Who are you to judge him? (darkening) I was trying to give you a heads up, keep you out of his way, I don't even know why. But if you think you and I have some kind of relationship -- that you're gonna give me, what, advice? You can disavow yourself of that notion right fucking now.Caesar is stunned.

But now we find ourselves on the eve of battle... against our own kind. So you may ask: who is the real enemy, who are we fighting here? And I'll tell you. It's not the apes.

Indecent. They call us a death squad. But they'll never understand the extent of our sacrifice. How agonizing it has been to do what must be done, even as it tears at our very souls. Because there are times when you must abandon your humanity in the fight to save humanity. All of you have shown the courage to do that... But now we must take that fight to them, or this hellish trial will all have been in vain. (beat, still walking through the ranks) We can not fail. We're the last defense. Somewhere in this world there are more survivors. And whether they know it or not, they are counting on us. To show the will to protect them against this new plague. We've seen it here. And it's already spreading up north. If we lose this battle, there'll be nothing to stop it from spreading everywhere. If we lose, in a matter of months, the human race will gasp its last words, and go silent.

Self-awarenessreturns to his eyes -- a look of humanity we haven't fullyseen since before the death of his family, as if the warwithin him is finally coming to an end.The Colonel gapes helplessly... as Caesar, quietly stunned byhis own decision, starts to back away... Caesar pauses,pitying eyes on the Colonel's; then finally, he gently setsthe gun back down onto the table.A look of confused gratitude flickers through the Colonel'sprimitive gaze... and he resumes REACHING LAMELY for the gun.Eyes still on him, Caesar backs slowly out --INTO THE CONTROL ROOMWe see Caesar, his back to us, as he continues gazing intothe Colonel's sleeping quarters... then, after a quiet,clumsy fumbling sound, a SINGLE GUNSHOT echoes from the room.Caesar remains still, then lowers his head as day breaksoutside...
